BEWARE! When you run the webserver you are potentially opening for
all your files to be red by the entire Internet! The httpserver is
only ment to be used for testing. If you absoulutely want to run this
httpserver for longer periods of time; consider creating a new user
with only read access to the files you want to share and running it
only with this user!
